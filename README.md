# Read Me Generator
![GNU License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GNU-blue)

This is a small console application that utilizes node.js, npm, and inquirer.js. It prompts the user with a series of questions and takes the user's input to create a ReadMe file for their project. Based on the user's choices, some sections can be selected to appear or not appear in the final read me. The options currently allow the user to add an installation section, usage section, testing examples section, contributing section, and contributors section. However, some sections are required such as the title, description, license badge, contact, and license section.
